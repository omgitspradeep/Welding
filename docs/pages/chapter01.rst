Chapter 1: Safety precaution of welding
=======================================

Definition of safety
====================

Safety measures should not be ignored or overlooked because it results in dangers like electric shock, arc radiation, fire and explosion and overexposure to fumes and gases. A good welder should familiarize himself with safety guidelines and practices.
Precaution to be taken care while working in workshop:

Safety of workshop
==================

|    1) Workshop should be built in place where air can pass easily

|    2) Workshop are should be in bright 

|    3) Workshop should be easily cleanable.

|    4) Machine inside workshop should be arranged with proper plan.

|    5) A workshop should have Cupboard, Box, Tools Box etc. to hold Tools and Equipment in proper order.

|    6) Flammable materials must be kept in separate place.

|    7) For welding works, workshop should have Portable Booth which prevents the rest people in workshop from its lightening effect.

|    8) Workshop should have Fire extinguisher and Water in reachable place.

|    9) Workshop should have First Aid box for unwanted mishaps

|    10) Always keep Record card for keeping record of machine parts repair or change to avoid unnecessary accidents

Safety of equipment's
=====================


|    1) Always read the user manual provided by manufacturer before operating machines.

|    2) Ensure that machine that runs on electricity must have proper earthing.

|    3) Never use fuse bigger than needed or required.

|    4) Never give machine overload and avoid working for long hours continuously

|    5) Always use oil in machine if machine have moveable parts.

|    6) If machine changes its usual working voice, then seek expert to fix.

|    7) Always use trolley while moving oxygen or fuel gas from one location to another.

|    8) Tie the cylinder to trolley or else with chain to prevent cylinder from falling.

|    9) Never use electrode holder with bad insulin.

Personal safety
===============

Some of the necessary personal safety are as follows:
    

|    1) Keep the area around you clean and tidy.

|    2) Build the habit of following instructions and doing work with care

|    3) Know your tools and keep them in respective locations

|    4) Always wear protective wearable like apron, goggles, masks, shoes etc. while welding.

|    5) Always have focus on work at hand and avoid unnecessary talks while working.

|    6) Never look weld with naked eye during welding

|    7) Always empty the flammable materials before welding Oil tanks or cylinder or Container of Pipe

Safety precaution during arc welding
====================================

Some of necessary safety precaution to be followed during arc welding are as follows: 
   

|    1) Safety precaution during gas welding Always keep your face out of weld plume and do not breathe gas created by flame.

|    2) Indoor welding requires adequate ventilation or fume extractor.

|    3) Safety glasses and ear plugs must be worn. 

|    4) Mask and protective clothes, boots, gloves and helmet must be worn.

|    5) Respirators must be used to avoid dangers from fumes and oxides.

|    6) Do not wear jewelry like ring and synthetic clothes.

|    7) Remove all ignition sources like matches and lighters from work area and post “no smoking” signs in the area.

|    8) Do not weld on surfaces that are still wet with a degreasing solvent.

|    9) Storage of compressed gas cylinders need to be done according to fire code guidelines.

|    10) Ensure the area is well ventilated and protect cylinders from contact with ground, ice, snow, water, salt, high temperatures and corrosion.

|    11) Do not drag, slide or drop cylinder and lift cylinder by the valve cap.

Accidents prone to Industries and inside Factories
==================================================

There are various reasons for industrial accidents and they are unsafe working conditions, unsafe acts and other causes like slippery floors and noisy environments. According to research from Tribhuvan University led by Dr. Rohit Kumar Pokharel in Nepalese industries, sixty-one percent of workers had experience at least one accident while working and thirty-seven percent work without meal while sixteen percent work even during illness.

Different accidents that happens frequently inside factories and industries are as follows:


|    1) Falling of working weakness or slippery floor.  

|    2) Eye damage due to dust and blare.

|    3) Skin mishaps like burn, cut, wounds, allergies etc.

|    4) Stuck by falling object. For example, 7 workers died and 35 were injured when the Itahari brick kiln collapse.

|    5) Dislocate of body parts by falling, piercing and cutting. Machinery not maintained in proper condition also causes mishaps.

|    6) Hearing defects due to noise in factories.

|    7) Blast when explosive elements activates.

|    8) Burning of factories premises when fire catches.

|    9) Gas leak cause the problem in respiratory system and prone to firing.

|    10) Nuclear leak can cause nuclear disaster around the industry surrounding. For example, a nuclear plant in Japan after earthquake leaks 520 tons of radioactive water into the sea.
